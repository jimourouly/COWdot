# Making a game in GODOT 
- I mean it's not really a game, more like I watch a youtube tutorial

## Features I would like to add

- save the cow from their unstoppable seizure
- make the "roof" layer disappear when the player is underneath
- add an action button when near a cow
- load a new scene when the player goes off map
